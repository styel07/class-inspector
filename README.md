# class-inspector

Your Challenge

Reflection is a common utility in Object Oriented languages for inspecting classes and deriving information about what properties/methods they expose and other classes they inherit from. We will be writing our own JavaScript reflector today!

We are going to write a simple utility that will inspect a given object, and tell us about the object and it's inheritance chain.

Your Tasks

Create 3 classes:
User
GroupUser
SuperUser
Create a number of methods on the prototype of each class and create the following inheritance:
GroupUser inherits from User
SuperUser inherits from GroupUser
Write a function called reflector that takes in an instance of an object and use console.log() to print out the name of the current class, and the methods and properties that belong to only that class.
If this class inherits from another class, you should then repeat for each level of inheritance all the way up the prototype chain until you can't go any further.
Don't forget to create this as a repository and push to your GitHub account with good naming convention.
Hints

One method that we haven't specifically covered that will be useful to completing the challenge is Object.getPrototypeOf()
The constructor property also has a name property. It might be useful.
This is probably a good use case of......recursion! :D
Stretch Goals

Create your function to work whether it takes in an instance of a class, or a reference to the constructor function by name.
